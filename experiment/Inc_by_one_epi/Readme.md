# Objective:
 To study how the quality of learned policy changes as the "percentage of real changes"
 ## Assumptions/Setting:
- initial param :
[[ 0.0174, -0.1990, -0.0372,  0.3741,  0.0769,  0.0338,  0.3562],
        [-0.1931,  0.2764, -0.0541, -0.0509,  0.2145, -0.2138,  0.1645]]
- initial D_real to start with : 10
- Model have access to the terminal state in prior: False
- number of inner loops : 1
- number of outer loops : 2000
- increament count: 1
